In the following we analyse
[Posts](https://github.com/ag-gipp/19emsMathOverflow/releases/download/v0.1/PostHistory.7z)
that contain the string `zbmath.org`.

## Files in the repository

The following csv files, were all created using search
and replace in a standard text editor.


* [counts.csv](counts.csv) contains the number of all posts
(not only with links to zbMATH) grouped by month.
The first incomplete year and the current year were deleted.
* [mathoverflow-links-stat.xlsx](mathoverflow-links-stat.xlsx) is an Microsoft Excel File that analyses the date
distribution of the MathOverflow posts with links to zbMath in the table
dates.
